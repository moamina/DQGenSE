# DQGenSE|DQGen (Data Quality Generation for Software Engineering Dataset)

DQGenSE is a lightweight, automated framework designed to detect and validate data quality issues in software engineering datasets. Built on top of the Great Expectations library, it generates Python validation code from metadata and quality dimensions with minimal manual effort.

🔍 Key Features
Automatically maps data quality dimensions (e.g., completeness, uniqueness) to validation rules
Generates runnable Python scripts for validating data using Great Expectations
Supports structured validation across multiple data sources and formats
Reduces manual validation effort by up to 60% (based on real-world ISP case study)
📁 Use Cases
Validating large-scale SE datasets (e.g., bug reports, user sessions, logs)
Detecting issues like missing values, schema drift, inconsistent formats
Integrating automated data checks into data pipelines
🚀 Quick Start
Define your data source and metadata (tables, columns, types)
Configure quality dimensions (e.g., completeness, consistency)
Run the framework to generate GE-based Python validation scripts
Execute the scripts to validate and profile your data

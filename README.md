# DQGenSE|DQGen (Data Quality Generation for Software Engineering Dataset)

DQGenSE is a lightweight, automated framework designed to detect and validate data quality issues in software engineering datasets. Built on top of the Great Expectations library, it generates Python validation code from metadata and quality dimensions with minimal manual effort.

🔍 Key Features

1. Automatically maps data quality dimensions (e.g., completeness, uniqueness) to validation rules

2. Generates runnable Python scripts for validating data using Great Expectations

3. Supports structured validation across multiple data sources and formats

4. Reduces manual validation effort by up to 60% (based on real-world ISP case study).

📁 Use Cases

1. Validating large-scale SE datasets (e.g., bug reports, user sessions, logs)

2. Detecting issues like missing values, schema drift, inconsistent formats

3. Integrating automated data checks into data pipelines

--------------
🚀 Quick Start

1. Define your data source and metadata (tables, columns, types)

2. Configure quality dimensions (e.g., completeness, consistency)

3. Run the framework to generate GE-based Python validation scripts

4. Execute the scripts to validate and profile your data
